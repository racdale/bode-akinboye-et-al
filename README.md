DyAD data processing and analysis pipeline for CRQA analysis in Bode-Akinboye, Rietdijk, Dale, & Turkstra. (submitted).

The research used "Dynamic Analysis of Discourse" (DyAD) point-and-click interface to view transcripts, check analysis, etc. The core components of this workflow are a set of processing and analysis functions in R. These are included here, and reflect the "under the hood" processing in DyAD.
