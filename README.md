DyAD data processing and analysis pipeline for CRQA analysis in Bode-Akinboye, Rietdijk, Dale, & Turkstra. (submitted).

The research used "Dynamic Analysis of Discourse" (DyAD) point-and-click interface to view transcripts, check analysis, etc. The core components of this workflow are a set of processing and analysis functions in R. These are included here, and reflect the "under the hood" processing in DyAD.

*Note*: DyAD contains partial analysis for semantic and syntactic annotations of transripts as well. These are included as illustrations in the interface. The primary analysis in the paper is at the lexical level which is the most complete part of the DyAD interface.
